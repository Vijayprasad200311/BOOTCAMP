Task 4:model pop up

What I Learned:
Building this modal popup helped me understand JavaScript's event handling and how to manipulate the visibility of elements dynamically. I also learned how CSS can be used to create smooth fade-in and fade-out effects.

Difficulties Faced:
One challenge was ensuring that the modal functioned correctly across different screen sizes.

Final Thoughts:
This task was a great introduction to modals and interactive UI components.
