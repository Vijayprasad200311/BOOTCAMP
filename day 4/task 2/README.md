Task 2:Temperature Converter
What I Learned:
Building this project helped me understand JavaScriptâ€™s ability to manipulate input fields and perform real-time calculations. I also learned how event listeners can be used to capture user input effectively.

Difficulties Faced:
One challenge was handling edge cases, such as empty inputs or non-numeric values. Implementing proper validation and ensuring smooth interactions required some extra effort.

Final Thoughts:
This task was a great way to practice JavaScript functions and user interaction. It reinforced the importance of real-time data processing and error handling. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects
