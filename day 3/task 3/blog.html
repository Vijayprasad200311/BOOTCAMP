        <h1>Time To First Byte: Beyond Server Response Time</h1>

            <p>Optimizing web performance means looking beyond surface-level metrics. Time to First Byte (TTFB) is crucial, but improving it requires more than tweaking server response time</p>
            <p>Matt Zeunert breaks down what TTFB is, what causes its poor score, and why reducing server response time alone isn’t enough for optimization and often won’t be the most impactful change you can make to your website.</p>
            <p>Loading your website HTML quickly has a big impact on visitor experience. After all, no page content can be displayed until after the first chunk of the HTML has been loaded. That’s why the Time to First Byte (TTFB) metric is important: it measures how soon after navigation the browser starts receiving the HTML response.</p>

            <p>Generating the HTML document quickly plays a big part in minimizing TTFB delays. But actually, there’s a lot more to optimizing this metric. In this article, we’ll take a look at what else can cause poor TTFB and what you can do to fix it.</p>
