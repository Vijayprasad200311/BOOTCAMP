Task 3: blog
What I Learned:
Designing this responsive blog post helped me understand the importance of adaptability in web design. Ensuring a seamless reading experience across different devices requires careful planning and testing.

Difficulties Faced:
One of the main challenges was adjusting the layout to maintain readability on smaller screens. Fine-tuning font sizes, spacing, and image scaling took some extra effort.

Final Thoughts:
This project reinforced my appreciation for responsive design. A well-structured blog not only looks good but also improves user engagement. I look forward to exploring more advanced techniques in future projects.
