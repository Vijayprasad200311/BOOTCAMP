Task 2:product page
What I Learned:
Styling this product page helped me understand the importance of using classes and IDs for better organization. I also realized how CSS properties like padding, margins, and flexbox can enhance presentation.

Difficulties Faced:
One challenge was ensuring that the design looked good on different screen sizes. Adjusting image sizes and text placement required careful tweaking to maintain a balanced layout.

Final Thoughts:
This project improved my ability to use CSS effectively for product displays. I look forward to refining my design skills further and experimenting with animations and transitions for a more interactive experience.
