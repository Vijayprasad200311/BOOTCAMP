Task 4: design a menu
What I Learned: Creating this restaurant menu helped me understand the importance of structuring content clearly and making it visually appealing. Organizing items into sections made the menu easier to read and navigate.

Difficulties Faced: One of the challenges was ensuring that each item had a concise yet informative description. Striking a balance between detail and simplicity required some fine-tuning.

Final Thoughts: This project gave me a great insight into menu design and presentation. I now appreciate how well-structured content can enhance user experience, and I look forward to working on more design improvements in the future.
