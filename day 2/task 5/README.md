task 5:portfolio

What I Learned:
Creating a multi-page website helped me understand how to structure navigation menus and link pages effectively. I also learned the importance of consistency in design across multiple pages.

Difficulties Faced:
One of the challenges was ensuring smooth navigation and keeping the layout uniform across all pages. Making sure all links worked correctly and that the design looked good on different devices required extra attention.

Final Thoughts:
This task was a great way to practice building structured websites. I now have a better understanding of how to organize multiple pages while maintaining a user-friendly experience. I look forward to creating even more complex websites in the future.
